<p>Hades is a roguelike indie video game developed by Supergiant Games. You play as Zagreus, the son of the mythological Greek god Hades. Your objective game is to get yourself (Zagreus) out of the underworld with gifts you receive from the gods on Olympus. To explain in simple terms is a roguelike game that includes a dungeon crawl, usually though procedurally generated levels/rooms, often including critical elements such as permadeath, resource management, and hack and slash-based gameplay. </p>
